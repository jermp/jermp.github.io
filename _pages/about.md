As of June 2022, I am **Assistant Professor of Computer Science** at [Ca' Foscari University](https://www.unive.it/pag/13526) of Venice,
[Department of Environmental Sciences, Informatics and Statistics](https://www.unive.it/pag/28183).
Before that, I have been a Research Fellow in Computer Science at the CNR in Pisa, [HPC-Lab](http://hpc.isti.cnr.it), from November 2018 to May 2022 (3 times Young Researcher Award, for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021).

I obtained a PhD in Computer Science in March 2019,
and a Master Degree in Computer Science in March 2015 (Best Master Thesis Award
in Theoretical Computer Science from EATCS; Master Degree Award from Scuola Superiore
Sant'Anna) from the University of Pisa.

I keep an updated copy of my CV [here](https://github.com/jermp/curriculum_vitae/blob/master/CV_GiulioErmanno_Pibiri.pdf).

My research activity focuses on the design and implementation of compressed data structures for indexing large quantities of data
coming from different fields of Computing,
such as Bioinformatics, Information Retrieval, and Natural Language Processing.
The main objective is to improve the efficiency of complex tasks in these fields by providing *efficient* (i.e., "fast")
and *effective* (i.e., "small") indexes to maintain/query data.
In fact, a compressed index uses less storage space than the original data, thus permitting:

- for a fixed memory budget, to handle larger datasets;
- for the same dataset, to maintain its compressed representation
in faster memory levels (e.g., RAM instead of disk),
hence granting faster access.

I am committed to efficient software production: my software is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jermp).

Some research problems I have worked on include:
Compressed and Weighted Dictionaries for K-Mers,
Minimal Perfect Hashing,
Rank/Select and Prefix-Sum Queries,
Bitmap Compression,
Indexing and Estimation of Language Models,
Inverted Index Compression.
