#### **Miscellanea**

C++ utilities that I used as sub-modules for larger projects.

**[essentials](https://github.com/jermp/essentials)** --
A C++ library providing essential core utilities for data structure design and benchmarking. More precisely:

- benchmarking facilities, including: messages displaying local time, configurable timer class, function to prevent code elision by compiler, simple creation and printing of json documents;
- functions to serialize-to and load-from disk data structures;
- functions to compute the number of bytes consumed by data structures;
- support for creating, removing, and iterate inside directories;
- transparent support for contiguous memory allocation.

**[cmd_line_parser](https://github.com/jermp/cmd_line_parser)** --
Command line parser for C++17. It offers all handy features in just 150 lines of code.

**[mm_file](https://github.com/jermp/mm_file)** --
A self-contained, header-only, implementation of memory-mapped files in C++ for both reading and writing.
