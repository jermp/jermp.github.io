#### **Editorial boards**

- I am member of the editorial board of [Information Systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/information-systems/about/aims-and-scope).

- I am member of the editorial board of [Discover Computing](https://link.springer.com/journal/10791/aims-and-scope) (formerly known as *Information Retrieval Journal*).

- I serve as a recommender (similar to an editor) of [PCI Mathematical and Computational Biology](https://mcb.peercommunityin.org).

#### **Special Issues**

- Together with Dominik Kempa (Stony Brook University) and Nicola Prezza (Ca' Foscari University of Venice), I am guest editor for the special issue *"Computation over compressed data"* (selected papers from DCC 2024) in Information Systems.
